A German court decreed that Google Fonts must be stored locally to comply with GDPR (a European law on protection of personal data). As a result, fraudsters have already tried to extort money from site owners who didn't store the fonts locally.</br></br>To prevent situations when someone asks you for money or threatens to go to court because of Google Fonts, you can now store the fonts locally. To do it, just press the button below. After you do it, check the storefront to ensure that everything looks ok.
